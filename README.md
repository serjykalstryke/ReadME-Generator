## Description 
This is a simple application that generates a readme file based on user inputs. It takes the name of the project, a description, and several other pieces of information and outputs a .md file based upon those inputs. It uses Node.js as well as several packages installed using npm, namely inquirer and axios. To generalize the use of this application, a user would need to add their own images to the assets folder and change the affiliated code and link to their own usage video.
